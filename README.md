Project Euler
=============

I decided to start tackling on some Euler Problems from [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net). Ruby will be the main languages but as time permits, I will attempt the problems in other languages.

**Spoiler Alert:** Do not browse around this repo unless you want to see how I solved some of the problems from the site. 

> Please do not deprive others of going through the same process by publishing your solution outside Project Euler.

You've been warned!

Goals
=============

My aim on this project, apart from improving problem solving skills, is to improve my TDD skills.

* I will add test cases wherever possible.
